JHD's Gantt chart resources.

Workplan.pdf is a Gantt chart I submitted recently.
Note that this was for a 10 person-year project stretching over four calendar
years, so is rather larger (and more complicated) than I would expect a
CM30082 project to me. Conversely, a CM30082 project should have a more
detailed timescale (weeks or months, not quarters) and go into more detail,
with blocks lke "unit testing" and so on.

Workplan.tex is the LaTeX file, but the actual chart is in TIPSGantt.tex .
pgfgantt is the magic package you need to include.

Hope it's useful, queries to me
