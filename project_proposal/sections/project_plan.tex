\section{Project Plan}

% Agile approach, loose deadlines, but ideally more frequent iterations
%   Slow sections on research and writing, but can start development alongside these sections, and once tracking / gesture recognition sorted can start developing frequent prototypes for interface for testing

% What items can be dropped if timeline an issue?
% What are the deadlines set for the milestones?
% When can each item be started, what is being worked on in parallel?

% Gantt Chart showing plausible deadlines and milestones
%   Not too specific and fairly broad (maybe overlapping sections to account for unknown time for deliverables)
