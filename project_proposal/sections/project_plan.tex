\section{Project Plan}

% Agile approach, loose deadlines, but ideally more frequent iterations
%   Slow sections on research and writing, but can start development alongside these sections, and once tracking / gesture recognition sorted can start developing frequent prototypes for interface for testing

For the execution of the work required for this project an Agile development strategy will be employed.\\
As such milestones / deliverables will not have specific dates/times\footnote{Unless a specified submission date/time has been provided for the course. These will be provided in YYYY/MM/DD format.}. Instead the Project Plan will primarily indicate the order within which work shall be completed, with start/end dates provided with respect to when in the month it will be expected\footnotemark[3].\\
The overlap between the end of the design sections, the start of their respective development sections, and the start of the write-up sections are to indicate that these can be performed to some extent in parallel. 
While researching a topic, the write-up can be started (documenting what is being researched), as can the development and testing of the relevant code.\\
This avoids scenarios where the next section is unable to be started while waiting for 'all' the research to be performed ahead of time.
Research and development can be much more responsive, resulting in less wasted time, and allowing more flexibility in the order/effort work is completed in/with.

% What items can be dropped if timeline an issue?
% What are the deadlines set for the milestones?
% When can each item be started, what is being worked on in parallel?
