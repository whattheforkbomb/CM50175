\section{Project Description}

% What are we intending to research?
%   Existing approaches to mobile device interactions utilising facial gestures / positioning of face w/r/t mobile device.
%   AR techniques for tracking lateral movement of phone, and pairing this with phone IMU rotation data to track phone movement (in particular with respect to the user's head).
%   3D user interfaces (e.g. VR/AR) projected to match user perspective w/r/t device screen (Wii, I-phone, & French guy examples)
%   Evaluating a potential mobile device interface developed using above research
%       Measuring accuracy of head/phone tracking / gesture recognition
%       Potentially comparing to existing interfaces / techniques
%       User study to evaluate user adaptability to interface / comfortableness.

% WHY
%   Traditional Touch interfaces typically have following limitations:
%       - Unable to interact when wearing most gloves
%       - Don't utilise full suite of possible interactions with most modern mobile devices (rotation, user gaze)
%       - Are limited to scrolling and 'switching' apps,, as no third dimension, require mapping navigational actions to gestures.
%   Works exist in the space, but limited to head orientation, or specialised hardware (?) Will expand upon, maybe focus on application of techniques?
% Proof or related investigations regarding above?

% What would be considered a success?
%   What are the core goals, 
%   what would be the stretch goals
