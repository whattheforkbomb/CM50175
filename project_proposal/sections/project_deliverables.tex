\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Deliverables}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An interface for an SHD which can be interacted with via head, gaze, and touch gestures.
    \item A report detailing the research, design, development, and evaluation of the interface.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements}
% What makes this a success
These are the criteria with which the project success shall be evaluated:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Must have an interface that can be evaluated (e.g. something that a user can interact with).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Could mock the interface (e.g. not a proper smartphone launcher, but an app/website representing a smartphone launcher).
            \item Should evaluate the interface with a usability study.
            \item Should permit user's to interact with device one-handed (e.g. head/gaze gestures should extend user reach while holding device with one hand).
            \item Could extend the display with 3\textsuperscript{rd} dimension, adding depth to the interface from user's perspective.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Must have working head tracking.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Should evaluate against similar techniques/systems
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Should have working Gaze tracking.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Should evaluate against similar techniques/systems
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
