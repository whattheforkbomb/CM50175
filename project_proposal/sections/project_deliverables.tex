\section{Deliverables}

% What are we planning to make
%   A tool/lib to track the phone's movement around the user using IMU and AR camera tracking (Potentially some ML here?)
%   A tool/lib utilising the above to parse movement/positions as gestures (Potentially some ML here?)
%   Creating a prototype interface to utilise the gesture tool/lib to allow user to interact with their mobile device via head gestures.
%   Possibly extending the interaction to PC/laptop monitor/display
%   Possibly extending with additional gestures beyond head/face (time permitting)
%   User study to evaluate the interface and compare with other approaches (and traditional touch interfaces)
