Lit review:
    [ ] Thumb Reachability on Mobile Devices ???
            Quick summary/review of using phone with modern screen sizes | Find References on any studies

    [ ] Head Gestures / Control
     |- Head gestures generally (not specific to mobile devices) | Find References
     |  |- Head Gestures On Mobile Devices 
     |  |- Head Controls With Mobile Devices | Already Have plenty of references
     |     |- One-handed & Hands-Free interaction
     |- Head Tracking Techniques (From Special hardware to camera only) | Find References
     |- Types of Gesture (Semantic Vs Spatial) and Examples | Find References
     
    [ ] Adaptive Interfaces
     |- 3D Interfaces (AR/VR) | Find References
     |   |- Having additional content off-screen that can be accessed by changing perspective
     |   |- Responsive to phone movement vs head movement | Find References
     |- Context Aware UI | Find References
        |- Reactive to user context to adjust on screen elements
        |- Reactive to head/gaze?

Intro:
    [ ] Read paper on crafting an intro, take notes from other intros

    [ ] Structure
     |- Mobile devices, however SIIDs and Large Screens
     |- Two different attempts to solve the problems
        |- Additional Input Modalities
        |  |- Thumb Gestures
        |- Adaptive Interfaces
           |- Context Aware UI
           |- 3D Interfaces

    [ ] Thumb Reachability 

    # below are effectively avenues of potential solutions
    [ ] Input modality attempts

    [ ] specifically head gestures

    [ ] adaptive UI



Prototypes:
    [ ] Language/Framework
     |-[ ] Unity (C# Or Java)
     |   Cross-platform, AR toolkit resources,
     |-[ ] Xamarin (C#)
     |   Cross-platform, Any AR tools?,
     |-[ ] Web (TS+Angular)
     |   Cross-platform, Possibly easier to test/deploy, CPU limited (I think), Deal with multiple browsers...
     \-[ ] Android Developer Studio (Java)
         Android only
    
    [ ] Scope
     |-[ ] Head tracking approaches
         Try different approaches, e.g. AR, IMU + Motion Correlation (+ Head extraction), ML tools for head tracking + IMU
