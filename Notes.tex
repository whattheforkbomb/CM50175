% What 
% |- Will be developing and evaluating a system that permits the user to interact with their phone hands-free / one-handed
%
% Why
% |- Situationally Induced Impairments and Disabilities (SIIDs)
% |  | Scenarios where user is suffering some affliction induced by the environment they're operating within, and as such
% |  |  they are either unable to or have less ability to perform a task using their phone

sarsenbayeva2017challenges suggest further defining Severely Constraining Situational Impairments‚Äù (SCSI), wherein the the ability to input to the device is restricted.

% |- One-Handed use of a phone is common [Is this a valid statement?]
% |  | For simple tasks, you don't need to use more than one input via the touch-screen (e.g. just thumb)
% |  | Larger phone screen sizes impact usability of single-handed input (via thumb) [thumb reachability studies]
